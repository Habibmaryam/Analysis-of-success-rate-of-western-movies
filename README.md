# Data Cleaning

- Data cleaning was carried out on Microsoft Excel after which an analysis using pivot tables was done.
- Pivot charts were generated from the pivot tables analysis.
- The date of release column was split into three columns to perform a trend analysis on gain/loss from movies released.
- The data set was checked for duplicates, null values, and blank spaces. Blank spaces were filled with “not rated”  for the rating column. This is to prevent inconsistent 
  errors resulting from a not well-cleaned data set.
- The director, star, and writer columns were discarded because they were not used in carrying out analysis.
- A new column named “gain/loss” was formed from the gross and budget column
- A table was inserted to make data analysis seamless.

# Data Wrangling

- This section outlines the steps involved in data wrangling of the movie's updated data set.
- The first step is to identify the quality of the data set before it is used for analysis. The data set was checked for missing values, duplicate data, and unusual patterns 
   in the data set.
- This involves creating an extra column called “gain/loss” from the budget and gross columns to determine if the production of movies was worth it. In addition, - 
   unrecognized naming methods were rectified.
- Missing values and duplicate values were checked to ensure data integrity
- After ensuring that quality issues were resolved and transformation was complete, the movie_updated data set was ready for analysis.
- This process ensures that the dataset is reliable, consistent, and ready to yield accurate insights for various research, machine learning, or data visualization tasks.

**MONTHLY TOTAL BUDGET VERSUS TOTAL GROSS PROFIT**

**MOVIE GENRE BY SCORES**
Comedy is seen to have the highest total scores of 8,373.1 while mystery had the lowest score of 84.5. This might be because viewers are not so interested in mystery but rather need something to cheer them up as life can be challenging.

**Total sales in the month of release**
The month of June recorded the highest sales of **$24,417M** while a fall in sales usually occurred in September from the year 1980-2001. This could be because June appeared to be a peak period when families had time to unwind.
